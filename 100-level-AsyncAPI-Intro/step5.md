In this intergalactic journey, you explored AsyncAPI, a powerful specification for crafting asynchronous APIs. The first module discusses what AsyncAPI is and why to use AsyncAPI, exploring real-world AsyncAPI use cases.

Building on the basics, module two transitions into understanding Event-driven Architecture (EDA), showcasing how AsyncAPI fuels the design of both EDA and microservices.

The third module explores the AsyncAPI specification. You learn about the structure of AsyncAPI and its different components, such as info, channels, operations, and messages. You also learn to implement the request/reply pattern.

The fourth module focuses on hands-on experience with exercises for writing AsyncAPI code and documents from scratch. It also introduces AsyncAPI Studio for validating your documents.
