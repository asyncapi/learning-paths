In this learning journey, you explore Async API, a powerful tool for crafting asynchronous APIs. The first module discusses what AsyncAPI is and why to use Async API and explores real-world use cases where AsyncAPI is a valuable asset.

Building on the basics, module two transitions into understanding Event-driven Architecture(EDA), showcasing how AsyncAPI fuels the design of both EDA and microservices.

The third module explores the AsyncAPI specifications. You learn about the structure of AsyncAPI and its different components, such as info, channels, components, and tags. You also learn to define operations, messages, and schemas and grasp the request/reply patterns within AsyncAPI.

The fourth module focuses on hands-on experience by learning to write AsyncAPI code and documents from scratch. The module also introduces tools to validate these documents and practical exercises to solidify your learning.

   1. Explore various components such as info, channels, components, and tags.
   1. Learn to define operations, messages, and schemas, including the request/reply pattern.
1. Creating and Validating AsyncAPI Code and Documents:
   1. Gain practical skills in writing AsyncAPI code and documents from scratch.
   1. Utilize AsyncAPI tools to validate the created documents.
   1. Engage in hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding and skills.

## AsyncAPI tools


AsyncAPI Studio helps you design and create a blueprint for your asynchronous API. For example, you are planning a birthday party and drawing a map displaying how messages move from one friend to another.
Async CLI (Command-Line Interface) helps you run AsyncAPI using text commands in a terminal. For example, you type “Bake the cake” in the AsyncCLI, and the CLI bakes a cake for you.
Generator helps you plan and build the initial structure of your project. For example, It's like having an assistant who sets up the starting point of your birthday party.
AsyncAPI Studio helps you draw your API plans, the CLI checks if everything's in order, and the Generator magically creates the starting point for your projects.
